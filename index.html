        <!--href="https://theodinproject.com/about" is an example of an absolute link. It is a link that goes pages on other websites-->

        <!--href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. It this is not present
        it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. The _blank argument will open the resource in another
    tab or window.-->

        <!--the rel attribute describes the relationship between the current page and the linked document. The "noopener noreferrer" argument
        prevents the opened link from gainin access to the webpage it came from and it prevents the opened link from knowing which 
    webpage or resource has a link to it.-->

        <!--This is an example of a relative link. Since this page is in the same directory as my index.html page, I can link to other pages 
        in the same directory as my home page-->
